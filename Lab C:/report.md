# Neural Network Training Report

## Trained Parameters
The output of the trained neural network model provides insight into the learned weights and biases:
```python
Trained parameters: {
    'hidden_weights': array([[-0.95962992,  0.57157335],
                             [ 0.26654501,  0.5312201 ]]), 
    'hidden_biases': array([[0.],
                            [0.]]), 
    'output_weights': array([[-0.14778547,  0.45945968]]), 
    'output_biases': array([[0.]])
}
```

## Observations:
1. **Hidden Layer Weights and Biases:
- The hidden layer consists of two nodes, each with corresponding weights and biases.
- The weights determine the strength of the connections between input and hidden layer nodes.
- The biases provide an additional input to each hidden layer node, influencing their activation.
2. **Output Layer Weights and Biases:
- The output layer has one node with its weights and bias.
- The weights determine the strength of the connection between hidden layer nodes and the output node.
- The bias provides an additional input to the output node.
3. Network Configuration:
- The network architecture comprises an input layer with two nodes, a hidden layer with two nodes, and an output layer with one node.
- Sigmoid activation functions are used in both the hidden and output layers to transform inputs into outputs.
**Effectiveness of Training:**
- The loss function value after training indicates the effectiveness of the training process.
- Further evaluation, such as testing the network on a separate dataset, may be necessary to assess its performance.

## Conclusion:
- The trained parameters provide insight into the learned connections and biases of the neural network.
- The network configuration appears appropriate for the XOR problem, with two input nodes representing the binary input and one output node predicting the binary output.
- Visualizing the network with the learned weights and biases can help confirm its correctness and provide a better understanding of its decision-making process.

## Network Visualization
To visualize the neural network with the learned parameters, we can represent the nodes as circles and the connections as lines with weights indicated. This visualization can help confirm whether the network has learned the correct patterns for the XOR problem.
